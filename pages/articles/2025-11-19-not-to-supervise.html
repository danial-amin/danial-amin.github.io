                <p>Supervision is where most organizational dysfunction starts. Not from malice, but from managers who treat people like interchangeable parts, demand superhuman effort as baseline, and wonder why their teams burn out or leave.</p>
                <p>The problem isn&#39;t that supervisors don&#39;t care. It&#39;s that they operate on autopilot, following patterns they inherited without questioning whether those patterns actually work. They do the same things that frustrated them when they weren&#39;t in charge, then act surprised when their teams respond the same way they did.</p>
                <div class="principle-box">
                <strong>Core Truth:</strong> Bad supervision compounds. Every mistake you make as a supervisor doesn't just affect one person—it cascades through team dynamics, productivity, and retention. Get this right or watch your best people leave.
                </div>
                
                <h2>The Problem With Supervision</h2>
                <p>Most supervision training focuses on tactics—how to run meetings, give feedback, set goals. All useful, but missing the point. The real failures happen at a more fundamental level, in how supervisors think about the humans they&#39;re responsible for.</p>
                <p>You can master every management framework and still fail if you treat your team like resources to be optimized rather than people with individual contexts, capabilities, and limits. The principles that follow aren&#39;t about process. They&#39;re about the mindset shifts that separate supervisors who retain talent from those who burn through it.</p>
                <h2>Seven Principles</h2>
                <h3>1. Do Not Generalize</h3>
                <p>People aren&#39;t uniform. What motivates one person demotivates another. The feedback that helps one team member improve will shut down someone else completely. Treating everyone identically isn&#39;t fair—it&#39;s lazy.</p>
                <p>Your job is to understand individual contexts. One person thrives with autonomy, another needs structure. One wants aggressive stretch goals, another is already dealing with challenges you don&#39;t see. Generalizing means you&#39;ll get it wrong for most of your team most of the time.</p>
                <p>This doesn&#39;t mean favoritism. It means adapting your approach to actual humans instead of managing to an imaginary average employee who doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
                <h3>2. Have Trust and Faith</h3>
                <p>If you don&#39;t trust someone to do their job, either you hired wrong or you&#39;re managing wrong. Micromanagement isn&#39;t supervision—it&#39;s a signal that something broke in the relationship, and hovering over someone&#39;s shoulder won&#39;t fix it.</p>
                <p>Trust means giving people room to work differently than you would. It means not requiring constant status updates to feel secure. It means believing that silence doesn&#39;t equal slacking and that your team can solve problems without you inserting yourself into every decision.</p>
                <p>When trust is missing, address the root cause directly. If someone genuinely can&#39;t be trusted with their responsibilities, manage them out. If the problem is your own anxiety, that&#39;s yours to fix, not theirs to accommodate.</p>
                <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>Reality Check:</strong> Trust isn't naive optimism. It's the baseline assumption that competent adults can do their jobs. If you can't operate from that assumption, the problem isn't them.
                </div>
                
                <h3>3. Do Your Part Correctly</h3>
                <p>You can&#39;t expect your team to meet standards you don&#39;t hold yourself to. If you&#39;re late to meetings, they&#39;ll be late. If you respond to emails at midnight, they&#39;ll feel pressure to do the same. If you cut corners, they&#39;ll cut corners.</p>
                <p>This isn&#39;t about being perfect. It&#39;s about modeling the behavior you actually want. Don&#39;t ask for transparency if you hoard information. Don&#39;t demand accountability if you deflect blame upward. Don&#39;t preach work-life balance while sending weekend Slack messages.</p>
                <p>Your team watches what you do more than they listen to what you say. Act accordingly.</p>
                <h3>4. Praise in Public, Counsel in Private</h3>
                <p>Recognition works best when it&#39;s visible. Criticism works best when it&#39;s not. This isn&#39;t complicated, but people get it wrong constantly.</p>
                <p>Public praise reinforces what good work looks like and shows the team that contributions get noticed. Private correction protects dignity and makes people actually receptive to feedback instead of defensive.</p>
                <p>The exception is when public correction is necessary to stop immediate harm or address behavior that affects the whole team. Even then, focus on the behavior, not the person, and follow up privately afterward.</p>
                <h3>5. Share the Responsibility</h3>
                <p>Hoarding decision-making authority makes you a bottleneck and prevents your team from developing judgment. Decisions that could be made at the team level shouldn&#39;t require your approval.</p>
                <p>Sharing responsibility means delegating real authority, not just tasks. It means letting people own outcomes, including the mistakes. It means being clear about boundaries—what decisions are truly yours versus what you&#39;re just being copied on out of habit.</p>
                <p>When things go wrong with delegated work, that&#39;s on you too. You chose to delegate, you provided the context and constraints, you set expectations. Own the outcomes whether they succeed or fail.</p>
                <div class="principle-box">
                <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Your job isn't to make every decision. It's to build a team that makes good decisions without you. That only happens if you actually let them decide.
                </div>
                
                <h3>6. Going Above and Beyond Should Not Be a Routine</h3>
                <p>If &quot;above and beyond&quot; is required to keep up with basic expectations, your expectations are broken. Heroic effort should be occasional, not the baseline.</p>
                <p>When extraordinary work becomes routine, you&#39;ve normalized dysfunction. People will deliver when it matters, but if every week requires heroism, you&#39;re not building a sustainable team—you&#39;re burning people out and selecting for those who haven&#39;t figured out they can leave.</p>
                <p>Recognize exceptional effort when it happens. Then ask why it was necessary and whether you can prevent that necessity next time. The goal is to make normal work achievable through normal effort.</p>
                <h3>7. We Are All Human</h3>
                <p>You will make mistakes. Your team will make mistakes. The question isn&#39;t whether errors happen—it&#39;s how you respond when they do.</p>
                <p>Acknowledging your own mistakes shows your team that errors are fixable problems, not career-ending disasters. It creates an environment where people report issues early instead of hiding them until they explode.</p>
                <p>This doesn&#39;t mean accepting repeated mistakes or lowering standards. It means recognizing that humans aren&#39;t machines, that everyone has bad days and blind spots, and that psychological safety enables better work than fear does.</p>
                <h2>What This Means in Practice</h2>
                <p>These principles aren&#39;t abstract values to put on a wall. They&#39;re operational requirements for supervision that doesn&#39;t destroy teams.</p>
                <p>Start by auditing your own behavior against these seven principles. Where are you generalizing when you should individualize? Where are you micromanaging instead of trusting? What standards are you preaching but not following? Be honest about the gaps.</p>
                <p>Then address them systematically. Pick one principle where you&#39;re weakest and focus on changing that pattern before moving to the next. Sustainable change comes from deliberate practice, not from trying to overhaul everything at once.</p>
                <div class="principle-box">
                <strong>Remember:</strong> Your team doesn't need a perfect supervisor. They need one who's honest about their mistakes, consistent in their standards, and actually treats people like humans instead of resources. Start there.
                </div>
                
                <p>The difference between supervision that builds teams and supervision that destroys them isn&#39;t mysterious. It comes down to recognizing that you&#39;re responsible for humans with individual needs, limits, and contexts—and adjusting how you work accordingly.</p>
                <p>These seven principles won&#39;t solve every problem. But they&#39;ll prevent most of the self-inflicted damage that makes good people leave and turns functional teams dysfunctional.</p>
                <p>Stop supervising on autopilot. Start treating people like the individuals they actually are.</p>
